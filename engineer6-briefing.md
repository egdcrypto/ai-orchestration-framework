### Critical Security Test Scenarios

#### Threat Detection Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Threat Detection
  Scenario: Simultaneous threats detected
    Given multiple threats are present in the monitored area
    When the system detects both a weapon and suspicious behavior
    Then both threats should be prioritized correctly
    And appropriate responses should be coordinated
    And all incidents should be logged with proper timestamps
```

#### Emergency Response Testing
```gherkin
Feature: Emergency Escalation
  Scenario: Critical threat requires law enforcement
    Given a high-severity threat is detected
    When the threat level exceeds autonomous response capability
    Then law enforcement should be automatically notified
    And evidence should be preserved according to legal requirements
    And the incident should be documented for legal proceedings
```
